# Automation_for_API_pull_from_Crypto_Website
In this project, I created a method to use coin market cap website's API to pull data from it. 
After, I used Python to pull all the data and created a CSV file to append them. 
Then, I again used Pandas to process the data in this CSV file and created visualizations by using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
